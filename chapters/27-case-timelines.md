# Chapter 27: Case Timelines

Each case moves differently, but here’s a rough idea of what to expect.

## Court-Martial Timeline (General)

1. CID/OSI/NCIS opens investigation
2. Command review or preferral of charges
3. Article 32 hearing
4. Referral to court-martial
5. Motions, discovery, trial
6. Verdict → Sentencing → Appeals

## Admin Separation Timeline

- Counseling → Notification → Rebuttal window
- Hearing (if entitled) → Board vote → Separation

Time moves fast. Be faster.
