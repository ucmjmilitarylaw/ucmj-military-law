# Chapter 15: Military Rule of Evidence 412

MRE 412 limits what the defense can bring up about an accuserâ€™s past. But with the right motion, it can be overcome.

## 412 Motion Must-Haves

- Detail specific prior behavior relevant to truth/motive.
- Establish relevance to your defense theory.
- Connect to constitutional rights of confrontation and due process.

A sloppy 412 motion gets denied. A surgical one changes the trial.
