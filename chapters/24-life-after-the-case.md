# Chapter 24: Life After the Case

You went through hell. Now it’s time to rebuild.

## What to Expect

- Stigma from command and peers
- Delays in transition paperwork
- Challenges in getting a fresh start

## Rebuilding Strategy

- Get copies of all documents from your case
- Request discharge upgrades if eligible
- Seek support: legal, psychological, financial

You’re not alone. But you’ll need a plan.
