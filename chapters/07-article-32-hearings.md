# Chapter 7: Article 32 Hearings

What used to be a chance to win your case is now a tactical ambush by the government.

## Understand the Game

- Article 32s are now used to strengthen the prosecution’s case.
- Everything you say can be used against you—there’s rarely any upside to testifying.

## When It’s Worth It

- To expose a false accuser
- To challenge probable cause
- To lock in prosecution witnesses under oath

Treat it like a live grenade.
