A General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) is a silent career killer.

## GOMOR Truths

- Theyâ€™re often filed with limited evidence
- They follow you to promotion boards
- A bad rebuttal can make things worse

## Fight Back With a Rebuttal That Works

- Attack the underlying facts
- Provide context and mitigation
- Use OER/NCOERs, awards, and character statements
