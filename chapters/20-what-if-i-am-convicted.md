# Chapter 20: What If I Am Convicted?

A conviction isn’t the end—but it is a pivot point.

## What Happens Next?

- Sentencing: you still have a right to mitigation
- Automatic appeals in many cases
- Clemency opportunities
- Administrative fallout (discharge, registry, etc.)

## Take Action Immediately

- Appeal deadlines are short
- Preserve issues for review
- Don’t give up your rights out of shame or exhaustion

You survived the trial. Now survive what comes after.
