# Chapter 19: Defending Against Sexual Harassment

Sexual harassment allegations often begin informallyâ€”and escalate fast.

## Typical Evidence:

- Text messages and emails
- Sworn statements
- Rumors or unit dynamics

## Defense Strategies

- Reconstruct the context of communications
- Highlight consent and mutual interaction
- Expose ulterior motives or bias
- Use digital forensics to confirm or contradict claims

These cases are rarely black and white. Bring receipts. Fight back.
