# Chapter 5: Military Investigations & Your Rights

When investigators show up, it’s not a “conversation.” It’s the beginning of a legal trap.

## What You Must Do:
- Stay silent.
- Demand a lawyer.
- Never write a statement.

## What NOT to Do:
- Don’t talk to your chain of command.
- Don’t try to “clear it up.”
- Don’t post anything online.

Silence is strategy. Speak only through counsel.
