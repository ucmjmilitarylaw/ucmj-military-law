# Chapter 17: Defending Against Sting Operations & CSAM Allegations

## The Setup

Law enforcement often poses as minors online to bait suspects into saying or doing something incriminating. These “To Catch a Predator”-style stings can lead to charges of attempted enticement or CSAM possession.

## Your Defense Playbook

- Challenge intent: was there an actual minor?
- Expose improper agent conduct
- Dissect digital evidence and timelines
- Contest forensic procedures on device imaging

This is digital warfare. Fight it with technical skill and legal firepower.
