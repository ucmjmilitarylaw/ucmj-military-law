# About Our Military Lawyers

Michael Waddington and Alexandra Gonzalez-Waddington are not just attorneys. They are warriors in the courtroom and battle-tested defenders of America’s military. Together, they’ve spent over two decades fighting alongside service members—officers and enlisted, pilots and SEALs, infantrymen and intelligence analysts—defending careers, reputations, and freedom against the full weight of the U.S. military justice system.

They are a husband-and-wife team who’ve walked every step of this journey together. From college to law school to thousands of military cases around the world, they’ve forged their careers in the crucible of military trial practice. Their life’s work has been defending those who defend America.

Michael’s journey began at 18, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army with his two younger brothers. All three became officers. His oldest son, Alexander, enlisted in the Army at 17 and deployed to Afghanistan during the final phase of the war. Now, both of their children—Alexander and their daughter—are pursuing law themselves, continuing the legacy of service and defense.

The Waddingtons have successfully defended every type of case the military can bring—from SHARP and SAPR cases to war crimes, murder, classified intelligence, violent offenses, and “no-win” sexual assault allegations. They’ve taken on cases in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, and across the United States. When Special Forces colonels, Top Gun pilots, or Navy SEALs are accused of rape or misconduct, they call the Waddingtons. When a young Private with no resources is told to plead guilty or face decades in prison, the Waddingtons step in and give that soldier a fighting chance.

Michael and Alexandra fight like gladiators to defend their clients’ rights—relentless, strategic, and always united. They’ve built a national reputation for winning cases that others wouldn’t touch—because they don’t back down, and they never follow a script. Every case is built from the ground up, with a tailored defense shaped by decades of experience and uncompromising dedication. They keep their caseload small on purpose, so they can personally control every detail. They don’t hand trials off. They defend servicemembers as a cohesive team—with precision, power, and purpose.

Their approach is not just legal. It’s strategic. It’s personal. They believe in fighting smart, hard, and with discipline. They train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, stay physically fit, and live with the intensity they bring into each case. Because they know their clients are counting on them to lead the charge when everything is on the line.

They’ve authored some of the leading books on cross-examination, sexual assault trial defense, and criminal defense strategy. They teach military and civilian lawyers how to win tough trials. They write to train, to share, and to sharpen the profession—because when they step into court, they want to be lethal.

In a system built to convict and separate, Michael and Alexandra Gonzalez-Waddington are defenders by instinct and by design. They’re not here for shortcuts. They’re here for war—and they bring the skill, discipline, and ferocity to win it.

**If you’re in the fight of your life, these are the lawyers you want standing beside you.**
